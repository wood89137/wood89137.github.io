So far his personality and mine are so so compatible.  I feel so lucky to have found him, thank you SO MUCH for raising such a little love muffin.  I took him for a little ride today to the local Petco.  Kept him in my arms and new dog carrier.  He did get car sick again on the way back.  Poor little Mochi.  He seems to be doing well otherwise.  I will tell you that I snuck up on him late last night and he was snuggled with his toy that has his "home scent".  Awwwe, it almost broke my heart!  I have been trying to take him everywhere with me to get him used to strangers.  He is such a doll!  Seriously.  :-D  I took him to the office with me on Monday and he was so so good there, I can't tell you!  My co-workers are in love.  One of them took him to her desk and posed him for a picture which I have attached.  You can't tell if he is real or not!  Haha.   I cannot tell you how much of a dream he is.  He is seriously the best dog in the world.  We have started training him a bit.  He can already sit, come and stay (for a little while).  So far so good (fingers crossed).  He is so puppy pad trained it's insane!  (THANK YOU FOR THAT!) He is to die for.  I know how hard it was for you to give him up.  I want to thank you so much for that.  I will keep you posted with every little tidbit of news, photos and videos of him and maybe a little play date too!!&nbsp;</p><p>Thanks again for everything.  I will be checking your website daily to keep up with all of Mochi's relatives and family!  Hee hee.&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1.125rem;">.”</span></p></div>
